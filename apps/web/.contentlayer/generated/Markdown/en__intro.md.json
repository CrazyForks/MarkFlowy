Currently, it supports one click export of conversations, translation of articles to any language, and obtaining article abstracts. It also supports large models such as `DeepSeek` and `Chatgpt` to make them your intelligent assistants.\n- **Super lightweight**. The MarkFlowy is based on tauri and has a volume of less than 10MB and better performance.\n- **High availability**. MarkFlowy uses the remirror editor, which not only provides high scalability, but also has a great editing experience. And, MarkFlowy supports multiple editing modes, such as `source code`, `wysiwyg`.\n- **Custom Theme**. MarkFlowy supports custom themes, and you can also share your themes with others.\n\n## Download\n\nAvailable for Linux, macOS and Windows.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Because of Apple’s security policy restrictions on software without developer certification, the **macOS aarch64** version cannot be downloaded and used directly. You can ignore the limit by doing the following:\n> - Open your terminal\n> - Go to the `Applications` directory. .e.g `/Applications`.\n> - Run `xattr -cr MarkFlowy.app` and open the app again\n> - Please make sure you download from `github releases` or [UpgradeLink](https://download.upgrade.toolsetlink.com/download?appKey=xpn68m4j5qU0Y1rfDYFHaA).\n\nYou can download it from the [UpgradeLink download page](https://download.upgrade.toolsetlink.com/download?appKey=xpn68m4j5qU0Y1rfDYFHaA) or [GitHub Release](https://github.com/drl990114/MarkFlowy/releases)\n\n## Why\n\nAt present, I have used many Markdown applications, but I have not encountered one that is very suitable for me. I have always hoped to have a Markdown editor that is efficient, beautiful, lightweight, data-safe, and can be easily combined with various workflows. This It is also the original intention of doing MarkFlowy.\n\n## Contribute\n\nThe current MarkFlowy is still in its infancy, and there may be some bad experiences or bugs, for which I am sorry.
